        <h2>Research Goals</h2>
        <h4>
            Navigating the world around us is reliant on each individual's sense of space. Why is the study of chemical molecular structures easier to grasp for some people? Why can some people form seemingly perfect maps of cities in their heads? Yet,
            little is known about what kinds of external or internal factors are attributable to specific spatial skillsets. 
            Here, we try to explore spatial cognition's role in performance on large and small scale spatial tasks.
        <ul>
            <li>Studied how spatial experiences like hiking or programming affects navigation and mental rotation tasks </li>
            <li>Explored the relationship between everyday activities and specific spatial competencies.</li>
            <li> Investigated the impact of different interfaces (desktop vs. VR) on task performance. </li>
            <li> Examined familiarity with controls in different virtual environments. </li>

    <section id="methodology">
        <h2>Methodology</h2>
        <p>I used a mix of the following research methods to gather data:</p>
        <ul>
            <li> Participants: ~250 college-aged students from UC Santa Barbara and UC Irvine in-person tasks.</li>
            </li> 
            <li>Method: Observational (correlational) study, using a variety of spatial cognition measurements (Mental Rotation Tasks, Sense of Direction, Loop Closure, DSP Paradigm)</li>
            <li>  Conducted analysis to study descriptive statistics, generate a correlation table to fulfill pre-registered analyses and explore the data. </li>  
        </ul>

    <section id="findings">
        <h2>Key Findings </h2>
        
        <h3>

        <li>Video game experiences may impact both navigation and object manipulation ability in these virtual environments. </li>
       
        <li>Spatial cognition is complex and varies depending on large and small scale tasks.</li>
    
        <li> Reaffirmed that desktop and immersive virtual environments can capture measurements of distinct spatial abilities.</li>
