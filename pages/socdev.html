      <p> <i> Overview </i> </p>
        <h2 class = "heading"> 
          The U.S. is increasingly diverse, and people are given the option to claim more than one racial identity.
           </h2>
       
            <p> 
                In this research study I investigated how children view biracial individuals who flexibly present their identity based on context or by the situation.
          <p>
            It is important to understand how people perceive group membership (e.g., <i> can I trust this person? Are they an in-group or out-group member?</i>). 
            One way of studying this is 
            through a developmental lens.
        </p>
        <h2 class = "heading"> Past research suggests:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Adults judge biracial individuals who change how they racially identity based on context, known as Contextual Racial Presentation (CRP) negatively.</li>
            <li>Children use social markers such as race as a cue for ingroup (like me) and outgroup (not like me) for deciding who they associate with.</li>
            <li> Biracial people present an interesting conundrum because they have membership in multiple social groups. </li>
        </ul>

    <strong>Methodological Improvements</strong> 
    <ul>
        <li>Include diverse racial/ethnic groups in sampling</li>
        <li>Explore judgments of both high-status and lower-status monoracial children</li>
        <li> Control for and investigate the impact of perceptual features on racial categorization
     </li>
     </ul>
      </p>
<p>
    
      <strong> Deeper Investigative Directions</strong> 
      <ul>
      <li>Examine the role of mutual intentionality in group membership </li>
      <li>  Study how group approval might influence perceptions of CRP </li>  
      <li> Investigate how the stability of a participant's own racial identity affects CRP judgments</li>
    </ul>

    <section id="methodology">
        <h2 class = "heading">Methodology</h2>
        <p>I used a mix of the following research methods to gather data:</p>
        <ul>
            <li> Participants: 303 6-13- year-olds collected from Online and Offsite testing at a local zoo.</li>
            <li> Method: 2 x 2 between-subjects design, became 2 condition design (main character either maintains their biracial identity or switches to a monoracial identity.</li>
            <li>  Conducted logistic and linear regressions, Chi-squared test, Welch’s two-sample t-test to run pre-registered analyses and explore the data. </li>  
        </ul>
