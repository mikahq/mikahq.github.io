            Children’s Judgments of Dual Identities

          <h3>
            The U.S. is increasingly diverse, and people are given the option to
            claim more than one racial identity.
          </h3>
          <p>
            In this research study I investigated how children view biracial
            individuals who flexibly present their identity based on context or
            by the situation.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is important to understand how people perceive group membership
            (e.g.,
            <i>
              can I trust this person? Are they an in-group or out-group
              member?</i
            >). One way of studying this is through a developmental lens.
          </p>
          <h3>Past research suggests:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Adults judge biracial individuals who change how they racially
              identity based on context, known as Contextual Racial Presentation
              (CRP) negatively.
            </li>
            <li>
              Children use social markers such as race as a cue for ingroup
              (like me) and outgroup (not like me) for deciding who they
              associate with.
            </li>
            <li>
              Biracial people present an interesting conundrum because they have
              membership in multiple social groups.
            </li>

              Worked closely with my graduate student to structure the final

          <p>I used a mix of the following research methods to gather data:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Participants: 303 6-13-year-olds collected from Online and Offsite
              testing at a local zoo.
            </li>
            <li>
              Method: 2 x 2 between-subjects design, became 2 condition design
              (main character either maintains their biracial identity or
              switches to a monoracial identity).
            </li>
            <li>
              Collected data and analyzed children's judgments of biracial
              individuals using R.
            </li>

          <strong>Methodological Improvements</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Include diverse racial/ethnic groups in sampling</li>

            <li>
              Investigate how the stability of a participant's own racial
              identity affects CRP judgments
