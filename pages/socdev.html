        <h2>Research Goals</h2>
        <h4>
            As the U.S. grows increasingly diverse and people are more often given an option to claim more than one identity, it
            is important to understand how people perceive group membership. One way of studying this is 
            through a developmental lens.
        <ul>
            <li>Adults judge biracial individuals who change how they racially identity based on context, known as Contextual Racial Presentation (CRP) negatively.</li>
            <li>Children use social markers such as race as a cue for ingroup (like me) and outgroup (not like me) for deciding who they associate with.</li>
            <li> Biracial people present an interesting conundrum because they have membership in multiple social groups. </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Methodology</h2>
        <p>I used a mix of the following research methods to gather data:</p>
        <ul>
            <li> Participants: 303 6-13- year-olds collected from Online and Offsite testing at a local zoo.</li>
            <li> Method: 2 x 2 between-subjects design, became 2 condition design (main character either maintains their biracial identity or switches to a monoracial identity.</li>
            <li>  Conducted logistic and linear regressions, Chi-squared test, Welch’s two-sample t-test to run pre-registered analyses and explore the data. </li>  
        </ul>

            <li>Examine the role of mutual intentionality in group membership </li>
            <li>  Study how group approval might influence perceptions of CRP </li>
