    <h2> Overview </h2>
    <!-- <h3> Background </h3> -->
    <p> Spatial abilities can be developed by training and everyday experience, 
        but we know little about how different
            <span class="oval"><span class="oval-text">types of experiences</span></span> 
            are related to 
        specific spatial competencies. Does using maps while hiking improve skill in 
        navigation? Does playing video games improve the same (i.e. navigation) or different 
        (e.g., mental rotation) abilities?  
    </p>
    <h2> Research Questions </h2>
    <p> Previous studies did not look at performance in both large virtual environments & people's performance on object manipulation.
         We are interested in how everyday spatial experiences uniquely influence our spatial cognition. 
        <h3>For example, does experience hiking help us holistically process new environments (large-scale), or is it improving upon our mental visualizations? <span class="oval"><span class="oval-text">Can it improve upon both?</span></span>   </h3>
    </p>
    <p> We were also interested in how the interface of the test interacted with people's performance and experience.
       <h3> Would there be a familiarity with the controls of desktop tasks (computer) as opposed to 
        immersive virtual reality? </h3> </p>
        <p> With an increasing use of Immersive Virtual Reality in psychological studies and within the market, discerning any difference within performance based on interface would be of particular interest. Additionally, since video game experience is often accrued using desktop controls, one possibility could be that those with increased video game experience could perform better overall in desktop interfaces as opposed to 
        Immersive Virtual Reality (Richardson et al., 2010). </p>

    <h2> Key Findings </h2>
    <p>  <ul> <li> <p>With more video game experience and experience with competitive activites, there seems to 
        be a better performance in navigation within immerse virtual reality (like an Oculus!) and desktop cognitive tasks, 
        which is consistent with past literature (e.g., Malinowski & Gillespie, 2001). </p>
        <!-- <img src="/images/navigation_correlation.png" class = "responsive">  </li> -->

    <li> <p> There is a trending relationship with navigation acitvities and increased performance on navigation tasks 
        (again in immersive and desktop virtual reality)!
    </p></li>
    <li> <p> Other activity experience, such as creative or technical activities, do not seem significantly
        as related to navigation or object manipulation.
    </p></li>
    </ul> 
    </p>
    

    
    <h2> Methodology </h2>

    <p> We conducted statistical analyses on  responses to the 
        Southern California Spatial Activities Questionnaire (SoCalSAQ, Munns et al., 2022) 
        and a video game questionnaire to 
        seven objective spatial measures: two walking immersive virtual reality (VR) navigation task, two desktop VR navigation task, and 
        three mental rotation tasks. </p>
