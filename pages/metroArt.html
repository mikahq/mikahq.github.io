    <p>
        When I went there this summer, I was transfixed by the artwork on the walls. Whether it was mosaics or posters mounted in the subway car, this artwork is seen by millions of locals and tourists while it's on display. When I found a data source from the New York MTA titled "Permanent Art Catalog: Beginning 1980", I knew instantly that I wanted to try and dig deeper into what they recorded.

  <section id="team">
    <h2 class="heading">Team</h2>
    <p>This was an individual project â€” I handled data exploration, visualization, and analysis independently.</p>

  <!-- Process & Data Collection -->
  <section id="process">
    <h2 class="heading">Process & Data Collection</h2>
    <p>I used a mix of the following research methods to gather data:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Open source NY data webpage</li>
      <li>Cleaned and explored the data using R.</li>
      <li>Conducted sentiment analysis since data was largely characters.</li>  
    </ul>

  <!-- Analyzing the Data -->
  <section id="analysis">
    <h2 class="heading">Analyzing the Data</h2>

    <h3 class="heading">Durable materials</h3>
    <p>Artists were allowed to create their pieces in whatever medium they chose. For example, it was not uncommon for descriptions like "Bonded Bronze, Metalized liquid - resin and fiberglass" to appear in the dataset. In order to understand which materials actually appeared most frequently, I added up the times each word was mentioned.</p>

      <h3 class="heading">Most common materials used in NY Metro artwork (1980-2023)</h3>

        alt="A spiderplot of the most common materials used in NY Metro artwork ."

    <p>Durable materials like glass, stainless steel, and aluminum show up uniquely in these art pieces, many of which needed to withstand outside weather. These were pieces made with consideration and for longevity.</p>

    <h3 class="heading">Emotional art titles</h3>
    <p>Since I wasn't analyzing the actual images of the art, I was left with a lot of text. So I did an sentiment analysis of the titles of the artwork to see what I could find.</p>
    <p>By labeling individual words in the titles, I found that "joy" "anticipation" and "trust" were the top three categories. Artists conveyed positive associations with travel and waiting, although the title itself isn't what is on display. While a lot of words were considered neutral, emotions like anger and disgust are noticeably lower, which also makes me wonder if the artwork has to follow guidelines (e.g., stray away from certain polarizing subjects) or if the artists commissoned were already enthusiatic about public transit.</p>
