            Improving member–provider matching with AI

          <h2 class="heading">Summary</h2>

          <p>
            Healthcare referrals are often slow, inefficient, and frustrating
            for members, providers, and contact centers alike. As a contractor
            for Salesforce, I conducted mixed-methods research to uncover pain
            points in provider matching and identify where AI could quietly
            enhance workflows without eroding trust.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our recommendations focused on embedding AI in the background,
            automating verification, surfacing context for agents, and
            streamlining provider matching, so that care feels more connected,
            efficient, and human.
          </p>
          <h2 class="heading">Context</h2>
          <p>
            Fragmented systems and outdated referral processes increase
            administrative burden, delay care, and frustrate patients.
            Salesforce aimed to explore how AI could support contact centers in
            reducing burnout while improving member satisfaction and provider
            alignment.

          <p>
            I used Sheets and R to analyze the survey results. I used MAXQDA to
            extract themes, notably from the Provider side of the interviews.

            We created a swimlane for mapping intersections between members,
            providers, and contact centers presented a executive presentation.
            and alternative presentation method, the BART Clipper cards
            redesigned to create a community atmosphere around transport.

        <h3>Executive Report: Findings</h3>
        <p class="nda"> Full findings are restricted under an NDA. </p>

        <p> The following results come from the Provider interviews alone. We found that providers would likely be willing to adopt AI in the backend
            processes, but that forward facing implementations could be seen as abrasive.
        </p>
        <p class="quote">
          "I don't see that as a realistic solution because I've had patients
          call before and complain that when they call other offices, it just
          goes straight to like a robot.

          <u>That's what they call it, like a robot and not a real person. </u>
          Yeah, and they hate that.”

        <h2 class="heading">AI trust threshold: Generational differences</h2>

        <p>
          Current AI implementations like IVRs have created distrust due to
          inaccuracy.
        </p>

        <h2 class="heading">Cross-Departmental Message Decay</h2>

        <p>
          Patient information experiences significant "message decay" when
          traveling between departments.

          Providers see potential for AI to handle basic patient inquiries

          “Some of the questions our participants answered... could definitely
          be answered by AI. Very, very minimal kind of questions like that
          where it does take time out of staff’s day.”
