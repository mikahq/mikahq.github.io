    <h2 class="heading"> A local problem. </h2>
    
    <p>
      The Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) is a historic “heavy-rail public transit system” starting service in 1972. It acts as an essential public transit service for a wide variety of Bay Area citizens and creates social and bureaucratic discourse in its function. 
    </p>
    <p>
      After the COVID-19 pandemic BART’s ridership fell drastically, covering only 25% of the costs related to maintenance and upkeep in 2023.
    </p>
    <p>
      By continuing new expansion into the San Jose area, BART is following its initial goal in “completing the [transist] loop” and answering the general desire for expanded coverage of the Bay Area, specifically in the South Bay. However, a host of issues exist with the currently running lines impacted by every-day maintenance.

    <p>I used a mix of the following qualitative research methods to gather data.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Desk research</li>
      <li>Created an interview guide, interviewed target users, IDIs (N=5)</li>
      <li>Ethnography</li>

  <!-- Analyzing the Data -->
  <section id="analysis">
    <h2 class="heading"> Analyzing the Data </h2>
    <p> I used both Apple notes transcription and Otter.ai to transcribe interviews. I used MAXQDA to create themes and code the interviews
      afterward. I also used a document to organize quotes by themes to develop patterns.

    <h2 class="heading"> Presentation </h2>

    I created both an executive report and alternative presentation method, the BART Clipper cards redesigned to 
    create a community atmosphere around transport.

    <h3> Executive Report: Findings </h3>
    <h2 class="heading">Confusion about BART’s classification as a transit system led to dissatisfaction around wait times.</h2> 
    <ul>
      <li>Riders often struggle to categorize BART, seeing it as a hybrid of subway, metro, and commuter rail, which affects their expectations of the system.</li>
    </ul>
    <p> Solution: Create a marketing strategy to change riders' expectations and increase satisfaction. </p>

    <h2 class="heading">Public transit is an inherently social experience.</h2> 
    <ul>
      <li>Interactions with others play a significant role in rider's overall experience, with BART used most often on weekdays, such as Tuesdays, and used least on weekends. Commuters appreciate the opportunity to travel with others, 
        but crowded trains can feel welcoming, while emptiness may feel unsettling.</li>
    </ul>
    <p> Solution: Improve aesthetics. Install local artwork in stations (e.g., Oakland, Downtown Berkeley) to build community engagement, similar to New York City’s subway art installations.</p>


    <h2 class="heading"> Riders feel a transactional loyalty. </h2>
    <p>Despite vocal concerns about operational and environmental factors, BART still cultivates a somewhat transactional loyalty with its riders, especially around the reputation of BART. One participant said reflectively:</p>
    <h3> 
      “And I think that will always be the story of BART…people in general are thankful to have it. But nonetheless, it's going to be underfunded and neglected and really hard to improve.”
    </h3>
    <p>Participant feelings of loyalty and worth, suggest there could be a pattern of dedication towards BART and even other public services, like public radio, libraries, or other like-minded and/or community focused institutions.</p>

  <section>
    <h2 class="heading"> Remaining Questions </h2>
    <p>Many things. Among them are, how do the needs of BART riders geninuely impact their habits? Who used to ride BART, but doesn't now, and why? Who started to use BART after COVID? Why? Who does BART aim to serve, and who are they serving now?</p>
