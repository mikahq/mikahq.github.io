        <h2>Research Goals</h2>
        <h4>
        <ul>
            <li>The Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) is a historic “heavy-rail public transit system” starting service in 1972. After the COVID-19 pandemic BART’s ridership fell drastically, covering only 25% of the costs related to maintenance and upkeep in 2023. </li>
            <li>With a change in the work/life balance, there exists a need to understand BART’s current and potential ridership and offer actionable improvements to the BART system. </li>
        </ul>
        </h4>
    </section>

    <section id="methodology">
        <h2>Research Methodology</h2>
        <p>I used a mix of the following qualitative research methods to gather data:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Interviews with target users, IDIs</li>
            <li>Desk research</li>
            <li> Ethnography </li>
        </ul>
        
    </section>

    <section id="findings">
        <h2>Key Findings </h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Confusion about BART’s identity:</strong> Riders often struggle to categorize BART, seeing it as a hybrid of subway, metro, and commuter rail, which affects their expectations of the system.</li>
            <li><strong>Public transit as a social experience:</strong> Many riders view BART as an inherently social experience, with interactions playing a significant role in their overall experience.</li>
            <li><strong>Complex relationship with safety and cleanliness:</strong> Riders’ perception of safety depends on the frequency of use—frequent riders feel safer, while infrequent riders associate BART with higher crime rates.</li>
            <li><strong>Crowded vs. empty trains:</strong> Commuters appreciate the opportunity to travel with others, but crowded trains can feel welcoming, while emptiness may feel unsettling.</li>
            <li><strong>Perception of safety:</strong> Frequent riders feel a greater sense of safety, while less frequent riders associate BART with crime, largely due to negative word-of-mouth.</li>
        </ul>

    <section id="recommendations">
        <h2>Recommendations</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>The art of maintenance:</strong> Dedicate actionable plans to the maintenance and upkeep of current BART systems, potentially prioritizing this over expansion efforts in the South Bay.</li>
            <li><strong>Create community involvement:</strong> Leverage the social aspect of public transportation by engaging the community in the upkeep and enhancement of BART systems.</li>
            <li><strong>Implement cleaning protocols:</strong> Update and enforce clean-station protocols to ensure a welcoming environment for all riders, such as adding more trash cans both inside stations and nearby.</li>
            <li><strong>Public art installations:</strong> Install local artwork in stations (e.g., Oakland, Downtown Berkeley) to build community engagement, similar to New York City’s subway art installations.</li>
        </ul>
