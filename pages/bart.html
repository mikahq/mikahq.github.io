          The Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) is a historic ‚Äúheavy-rail public transit system‚Äù starting service in 1972. It acts as an essential public transit service for a wide variety of Bay Area citizens and creates social and bureaucratic discourse in its function. 
          <p>
          After the COVID-19 pandemic BART‚Äôs ridership fell drastically, covering only 25% of the costs related to maintenance and upkeep in 2023.
          </p>
          By continuing new expansion into the San Jose area, BART is following its initial goal in ‚Äúcompleting the [transist] loop‚Äù and answering the general desire for expanded coverage of the Bay Area, specifically in the South Bay. However, a host of issues exist with the currently running lines impacted by every-day maintenance. 

        <ul>

            <li>üöå With a change in the work/life balance, we need to understand BART‚Äôs current and potential ridership and offer actionable improvements to the BART system. </li>
            <li> üìûThis work is a call to engineers, architects, and policy makers to decide where best to spend money within our transit systems considering the voices of BART riders.</li>
        </ul>

    <section id="solution">
      <h2 class = "heading"> Solution </h2>
      <strong>Confusion about BART‚Äôs classifcation as a transit system lead to dissatisfaction around wait times.</strong> 
        <ul>
          <p>
            
            <li>Riders often struggle to categorize BART, seeing it as a hybrid of subway, metro, and commuter rail, which affects their expectations of the system.</li>
            <p> Solution: Create a marketing strategy to change riders' expectations and increase satisfaction. </p>
          </ul>
      <strong>Public transit is an inherently social experience.</strong> 
      <ul>
            <li>Interactions with others play a significant role in rider's overall experience, with BART used most often 
              on weekdays, such as Tuesdays, and used least on weekends. Commuters appreciate the opportunity to travel with others, but crowded trains can feel welcoming, while emptiness may feel unsettling
            </li>
            <p> Solution: Improve aesthetics. Install local artwork in stations (e.g., Oakland, Downtown Berkeley) to build community engagement, similar to New York City‚Äôs subway art installations.</li>
            </p>

      </ul>
    <strong>Complex perceptions of safety</strong> 
    <ul>
      <li>Riders‚Äô perception of safety depends on the frequency of use. Frequent riders feel a greater sense of safety, while less frequent riders associate BART with crime, largely due to negative word-of-mouth. </li>
      </p>
      <p> Solution: <a href = https://www.noemamag.com/the-disappearing-art-of-maintenance/" 
        target="_blank"
        rel="noopener"
        >Revive the art of maintenance</a></li>
            </p>

    </ul>
      <h2 class = "heading"> Transactional Loyalty </h2>
        
    
        <p>
        Despite vocal concerns about operational and environmental factors, BART still cultivates a somewhat transactional loyalty with its riders. The perspectives surrounding the reputation of BART were the most conflicting. One participant said reflectively:</p>
        <h2 class = "heading"> 
          ‚ÄúAnd I think that will always be the story of BART‚Ä¶people in general are thankful to have it. But nonetheless, it's going to be underfunded and neglected and really hard to improve.‚Äù
          </h2>
Participant feelings of loyalty and worth, suggest there could be a pattern of dedication towards BART and even other public services, like public radio, libraries, or other like-minded and/or community focused institutions.

    <section id="methodology">
      <h2 class = "heading"> Methodology</h2>
        <p>Participants represented people who lived in the Bay Area in the last year or more, and used the BART at least once a month.
          I used a mix of the following qualitative research methods to gather data.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Desk research</li>
          <li>Interviews with target users, IDIs (N=5)</li>
          <li> Ethnography </li>
        </ul>

      <h2 class = "heading"> Scope </h2>
      <p> What this project is, and what it isn't.</p>
      <h2 class = "heading"> It is: </h2>
      <p> a brief qualitative overview of how Bay Area riders feel about the current state of BART in 2024.</p>
      <h2 class = "heading"> What it is not: </h2>
      <p> Questions could have been more narrowly tailored about actionable items to improve BART from the participants. </p>
      <p> More IDIs representing different BART riders based on frequency of use, or attitudinal/behavioral attributes would have
        made the study more robust.
      </p>

      <h2 class = "heading"> What is left: </h2>
      <p> Many things. Among them are, how do the needs of BART riders geninuely impact their habits? Who used to ride BART, but doesn't now, and why? Who started to use
        BART after COVID? Why? Who does BART aim to serve, and who are they serving now?
      </p>
