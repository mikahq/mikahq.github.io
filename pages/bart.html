        <h2>Research Goals</h2>
        <h4>
          The Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) is a historic “heavy-rail public transit system” starting service in 1972. After the COVID-19 pandemic BART’s ridership fell drastically, covering only 25% of the costs related to maintenance and upkeep in 2023.
          It acts as an essential public transit service for a wide variety of Bay Area citizens and creates social and bureaucratic discourse in its function. 
          By continuing new expansion into the San Jose area, BART is following its initial goal in “completing the [transist] loop” and answering the general desire for expanded coverage of the Bay Area, specifically in the South Bay. However, a host of issues exist with the currently running lines impacted by every-day maintenance. 

        <ul>

            <li>With a change in the work/life balance, there exists a need to understand BART’s current and potential ridership and offer actionable improvements to the BART system. </li>
            <li>This work is a call to engineers, architects, and policy makers to decide where best to spend money within our transit systems considering the voices of BART riders.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Methodology</h2>
        <p>I used a mix of the following qualitative research methods to gather data:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Interviews with target users, IDIs (N=5)</li>
            <li>Desk research</li>
            <li> Ethnography </li>

        <h2>Key Findings </h2>
        <ul>
          <h4>
            <strong>Confusion about BART’s identity</strong> 
            <li>Riders often struggle to categorize BART, seeing it as a hybrid of subway, metro, and commuter rail, which affects their expectations of the system.</li>
            <strong>Public transit as a social experience</strong> 
            <li>Many riders view BART as an inherently social experience, with interactions playing a significant role in their overall experience.</li>
            <strong>Complex relationship with safety and cleanliness</strong> 
            <li>Riders’ perception of safety depends on the frequency of use—frequent riders feel safer, while infrequent riders associate BART with higher crime rates.</li>
           </h4>
            <h3>
              "So I was told that this is very different from other um metrosystems in other cities... we were in
              Fremont at the time, so to get to San Francisco, that was longer... and
              then you're also like going through Oakland and I don't know."
            </h3>
            <h4>
            <strong>Perception of safety</strong> 
            <li>Frequent riders feel a greater sense of safety, while less frequent riders associate BART with crime, largely due to negative word-of-mouth. Commuters appreciate the opportunity to travel with others, but crowded trains can feel welcoming, while emptiness may feel unsettling.</li>
          
             </ul>
            </h4>
        <br>
       
        <h3>
        "...though I have the impression that oh, it
         <i> might not be very reliable in that sense,</i> and also that time I took the BART at night...There was a transition there and I remember we had to
          wait for 12 minutes maybe. Yeah, but it didn't feel that long in the at the time
          because I was with somebody. <i>I could imagine if it's like at night and you're the
          only person there, it could be a little unsettling.</i>" -- BART rider

        <h2>Recommendations</h2>
        <h4>
          Every person interviewed was a BART rider who used at least monthly, and through their interviews 
        <ul>
            <strong>Revive the art of maintenance</strong> 
            <li>Dedicate actionable plans to the maintenance and upkeep of current BART systems, potentially prioritizing this over expansion efforts in the South Bay.</li>
            <strong>Create community involvement</strong> 
            <li>Leverage the social aspect of public transportation by engaging the community in the upkeep and enhancement of BART systems.</li>
            <strong>Implement cleaning protocols</strong> 
            <li>Update and enforce clean-station protocols to ensure a welcoming environment for all riders, such as adding more trash cans both inside stations and nearby.</li>
            <strong>Public art installations</strong> 
            <li>Install local artwork in stations (e.g., Oakland, Downtown Berkeley) to build community engagement, similar to New York City’s subway art installations.</li>
        </ul>
