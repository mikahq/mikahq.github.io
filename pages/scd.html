    <p> I had the pleasure to act as an experimenter and research assistant for the SCD lab, 
        a wonderful lab which explores how children navigate their social world.
        I created a poster to communicate scientifc findings, conducted independent data analyes and visualizations,
        & helped with logo design.

    <h2> The SCD Lab contributes to research investigating the building blocks of social cognition. </h2>
    <p> I joined the SCD lab in 2022 as my introduction to experimental psychology.
        As I began to code videos, help with data collection, and conduct literature reviews,
        I also became interested in learning how to code data in the social sciences using R, and also how to 
        ask questions of my own. Below are a couple projects I worked on.

    <h2 style="color: rgb(158, 158, 158);"> Free Will </h2>
    <p> The Social Cognitive Development Lab runs miniature research questions based on findings from various papers 
        on developmental psychology. 
        I decided to spearhead a question of my own, based on the topic of childrenâ€™s development in the belief of free will. 
        I collected data from our adult lab participants (<i>N</i> = 13) and ran analyses in R. This was in a timeframe of one week!</p>

<h2 style="color: rgb(158, 158, 158);"> Children's Judgments of Contextual Racial Presentation </h2>
<p> As a part of my science communication and Honors Thesis in my senior year of undergrad, I
    presented work based on a senior researcher's work on how children view biracial individuals 
    who flexibly change their identity based on the context. I processed data collected from 300+ participants 
    and ran analyses such as logistic and linear regressions to investigate these questions.
