      <p>I'm curious about how people 
        <span class="oval"><span class="oval-text">interact</span></span> 
        & 
        <span class="oval"><span class="oval-text">learn</span></span> 
        about technology.
      </p>
      
        Right now I am at UCSB working on spatial cognition, developmental psychology, and dabbling in neuroimaging. 
        I also work with the SB Creative Lab in my spare time. 
        </p>
        <p> Tools that help me do this are <strong> R </strong> for statistical computing (descriptive statistics,
            correlations, t-tests, ANOVAs, regressions, agent-based modeling),
            <strong> Python </strong>Python for data cleaning and 3D printing, <strong> Javascript [p5.js]</strong> for creative computing, and 
            <strong>HTML/CSS </strong> for web development! </p>
            </p>
        

<p> I enjoy drawing, reading, and cooking in my spare time. I've recently picked up knitting! </p>
