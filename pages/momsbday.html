    <span data-text="0"> <p>"March 29th 1960
        3 days living in Encino Hospital. First dwelling. Dad was on Westpac so your mom [Alex!] came home to uncle Tony and Aunty Loras. I believed we stayed another month but hey I was 4. 
        [Reseda, Los Angeles]. From there, back to Clairmont in San Diego"</p></span>
     
    
    <span data-text="1"> <p>"We boarded the Presidential cruise line Roosevelt and spent 2 or 3 weeks to Japan. Kanko Hotel. Yokosuka, Japan. 
        We spent at least a month in the hotel. I doubt your mom can remember this but it pretty cool. At night you did not use the toilet without turning on light because odds were good a rat could be in the bowl." </p></span>
    
    <span data-text="2"> <p> "Negishi Heights, Yokohama.
        This is where your mom started to come into who she became. Even at a young age she took no shit from anyone. She would piss my friends off until they either said something wrong or tried to pick a fight with her. I learned to fight. You do not mess with me or mine. Early on your mom was strong! Maggie was born in the Naval Hospital Yokosuka.</p></span>

        Your ma was too young but paradise for me."</p></span>

        <p> "Then we moved to Aiea Heights(sp). We were the only non Asian family there. Do not know your moms memories but I loved it. From there we moved into navy housing again called 
            Little Makalapa. This was my favorite place of our navy life. I did extensive searches on the place at the royal Hawaiian hotel but could not find any references to the small houses we lived in."</p>
