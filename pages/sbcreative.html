        <p> <strong> The Problem </strong></p>
       <p> Habit and goal tracking apps are popular, but often lack features 
        which incentivize users to stay on the app. While features desirable for 
        habit tracking apps, such as Pomodoro timers or calendar views are integrated 
        into other apps, we have yet to see one which combines multiple features for its user.
        </p>
        <p> <strong> Groundwork </strong></p>
      
        
      <p> 
        In order to form a new habit or maintain an older one, internal motivation is crucial. 
        One important motivator is <i>social accountability</i>, which allows for a second view in celebrating new or old habits. 
        Therefore, how can people trying to form a goal <strong> start & maintain their habits </strong> through the aid of technology and 
        the presence of social accountability?

    <p> <strong> Research </strong></p>
    <p> Our team sent out a survey to UCSB students to assess the attitude towards habit trackers. 
        We found five key points defined their experiences:</p>

                    <li>
                        <p>Interviewees showed tendency to use different trackers for calendar events and tasks to do</p>  </li>
                        <li> <p>People indicated they used color tagging and progress bars frequently </p></li>
                        <li> <p>Most people said they used similar apps for short term goals, also informative for designing tasks and events! </p></li>
                       <li> <p>73.5% of our respondents noted they would benefit from “having a single location where you track your habits”
                    </p> </li>
                </ul>
