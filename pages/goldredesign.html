      <h2> Case Study: Redesigning UCSB's Class Registration </h2>
      <h2> Context and Background </h2>
      <p> 
        GOLD, UCSB’s online portal for class
        registration and viewing academic history, is
        often criticized for having an inefficient UX for
        class registration. Considering UCSB has around 25,000 students
        and some majors are impacted, having an efficient registration system is key
        for student success.
    </p>
    
    <p> Timeline <br>
        3 months (October 2023 -
        December 2023)
    </p>

    <h2> Objective </h2>
    <p> Rethink the current course registration
        process and design an improved and
        optimized interface to make class
        registration easier and more efficient for
        UCSB students.
    </p>
    
    <h2> Research Method </h2>
    <p> We conducted a survey with these goals in
        mind:
        <ul>
            <li> <p>
                To gauge and validate the major user pain
        points of using GOLD
        </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                To understand the user persona (WHO is
        using the website)
    </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
            Initial assessment and thoughts of GOLD
            </li>
        </p>
         </ul>
    <p>
        After brainstorming as a team, we came up with
        questions that inquired about class registration,
        ideal features, pain points, and ease of use for
        GOLD.
    </p>
    <p> Conducting user interviews and consolidating our thoughts through affinity mapping helped us discover
        key painpoints for the users. </p>

    <h3> Painpoints </h3>

    <h2> Methodology </h2>
    <p> We created user personas, finding the average user to be a UCSB student, ages 18-22 years, with 
        proficient skill in how to navigate a basic webpage. GOLD is used as a platform to register for classes, 
        and the user has additional information they find in GOLD to schedule quarterly course plans. There
        are various majors which utilize GOLD. </p>
        
    <h2> Results </h2>
    <p> This section highlights the design iterations I was primarily responsible for during this project. </p>
    <h3> Homepage/Dashboard </h3>
    <img src="../images/sbclgoldtwo.png" class = "responsive"alt="GOLD redesign painpoints">
        <p> Discovery </p>
    <p> 
        GOLD has many links which cause the user to open overlays and tabs which contain very little
        new information. To consolidate the amount of clicks and to reduce cognitive load, I chose
        to create a uniform dashboard to access various modules which were otherwise dispersed.
            </p>

        
    <img src="../images/sbclgoldone.png" class = "responsive" alt="GOLD redesign painpoints">
       <p> After creating a style guide for our team, we were able to create a sleek and efficient homepage for students
        to access upcoming deadlines, switch viewing modes for classes, and favorite their class
        schedule cart -- all one one page. 
       </p>

    <h2> Takeaways </h2>

    <h3>
    <ul>
        <li> <h3> Consolidated homepage </h3></li>
        <li> <h3> Relevant course descriptions </h3></li>
        <li> <h3> Advanced search optimization </h3></li>
    </ul>
</h3>
    <p>
    Due to the time constraint we did not have time to conduct user testing with the new design. 
    However, creating a consolidated homepage, utilizing the search function for classes, and creating a 
    new display for prioritized information for each class based on user research drove our redesign.
