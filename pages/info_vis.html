<h2 class="heading"> Datasets </h2>    
    <p> <a href = "https://data.sfgov.org/Culture-and-Recreation/Library-Usage/qzz6-2jup/about_data" > The San Francisco Library </a>
      boasts multiple branches in a densely populated city. They have an impressive dataset spanning 2004-2016, so I took a look. 
    </p>
    <p> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/books/best-books-21st-century.html">The New York Times</a> 
      also came out with a list of the "best books of the 20th century" polling different famous authors.
      Here, I was tasked to draw out differences and make comparisons.

  <section id="process">
    <h2 class="heading"> Process & Data Collection </h2>
    <p>I gathered the data for this project from the City and County of San Francisco and from The New York Times Best 100 Books from the 21st century.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Exploratory data analysis</li>

    <h3> San Francisco Library</h3>
    <p>
      While readership varies in other months, the summer is consistently busy. June, July and August
      see a massive spike in readership, regardless of the branch location. 
    </p>

    <h3> Generational differences in library communications. </h3>
    <p>The preference for contact methods in library communications underwent a shift around 2013. Phone, print and email were neck in neck until email rose ahead drastically. </p>
    <p>While the majority of people checking out books skewed older, around 65+ years, they had a more even preference for all methods. This constrasts with patrons under 55 years, who much prefer email.</p>

        <h3> Fiction becomes elite</h3>

   
    <p>From the New York Times dataset, we can see that out of the 100 books in the list, 71 of them were fiction.</p>
    <p>Non-fiction was a scarcer genre. Yet when we look at ratings from the general public, 
      non-fiction consistently ranked more highly than fiction, above a 4.0/5.0. 
    </p>
    <p>Secondly, I created an organized category of sub-genres by main genre. Historical books had a good mix of both fiction and non-fiction, but the genres were mainly siloed. Why aren't books, at least in this list, doing genre-cross overs? What about genres not mentioned or captured in this list?</p>

    <h3> Lessons learned </h3>
    <p>Choosing the message of the visual is key</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Before drafting a viusalization, writing down the goal or takeaway is crucial to guide the format I decide to go with!</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Understanding information will be left out</p>
    <ul>
      <li>When I choose to represent one kind of information or transform the data, there will always be other types of information I may omit for clarity.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Always room for improvement</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Not all of the visualizations I create will be as clear as possible, but I strive to incorporate feedback in the re-design!</li>
    </ul>
