        <p> <a href = "https://data.sfgov.org/Culture-and-Recreation/Library-Usage/qzz6-2jup/about_data" > The San Francisco Library </a>
            boasts multiple branches in a densely populated city. They have an impressive dataset spanning 2004-2016, so I took a look. </p>
        <p>
            While readership varies in other months, June, July and August
            see a massive spike in readership, regardless of the branch location.

        <h2 class = "heading"> Generational differences in library communications. </h2>
        <p> The preference for contact methods in library communications underwent a shift around 2013. Phone, print and email were neck in neck
            until email rose ahead drastically. 
            <p> 
                While the majority of people checking out books skewed older, around 65+ years, they had a more even preference for all methods. 
                This constrasts with patrons under 55 years, who much prefer email.

        <h2 class ="heading"> Interrogating The New York Times reading list </h2>
        <p> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/books/best-books-21st-century.html">The New York Times</a> 
            came out with a list of the "best books of the 20th century" polling different famous authors.
           Among them was Stephen King (a personal favorite). 
          Here, I was tasked to draw out differences and make comparisons.
        </p>

        <p> We can see that out of the 100 books in the list, 71 of them were fiction.</p>
        <p> Non-fiction was a scarcer genre. Yet when we look at ratings from the general public, 
           non-fiction consistently ranked more highly than fiction, 
            above a 4.0/5.0. 
        </p>
      <p> Secondly, I created an organized category of sub-genres by main genre. Historical books had a good mix of both 
        fiction and non-fiction, but the genres were mainly siloed. Why aren't books, at least in this list, doing genre-cross overs?
        What about genres not mentioned or captured in this list?
      </p>

    <section id="methodology">
      <h2 class = "heading">Methodology</h2>
        <p>I gathered the data for this project from the City and County of San Francisco and from The New York Times Best 100 Books from the 21st century.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Exploratory data analysis</li>
          <li> Generate questions into hypotheses about the data before conducting data analysis</li>
          <li> Data prep and cleaning in Tableau, Excel, and Observable Plot </li>
        </ul>
       

    <section id="scope">
      <h2 class = "heading"> Scope </h2>
      <p> 
        <strong> Choosing the message of the visual is key</strong> 
        <ul>
        <li> Before drafting a viusalization, writing down the goal or takeaway is crucial to guide the format I decide to go with! </li>
    </ul>
        <strong> Understanding information will be left out</strong> 
        <ul>
        <li>When I choose to represent one kind of information or transform the data, there will always be other types of information I may omit for clarity.</li>
    </ul>

        <strong> Always room for improvement</strong> 
        <ul>
        <li> Not all of the visualizations I create will be as clear as possible, but I strive to incorporate feedback in the re-design!</li>
    </ul></p>

      <h2> What is left: </h2>
      <p> Many things. Among them are how I can transform this webpage into a narrative which geniunely helps libraries undestand their
        customer's desires and help them access resources more quickly.
