    <h2> Overview </h2>
    
    <p>   In 2020, the electronic sports (esports) market accrued 1.1 billion USD in sales around the world, 
          rising in popularity (Newzoo, 2019). Prior research has found that playing these team-focused action 
          video games, such as 
          <h3> First Person Shooter Games, have had a marked effect on the domain of spatial cognition, 
          such as spatial imagery, and found a connection between video game performance and these sensory, 
          visual attentional, fine motor control, and memory mechanisms </h3> (Bediou et al., 2018; Brunyé et al., 2012; Spence & Feng, 2010). 
          <p> We also know that in teams, people engage in prosocial behavior, collaborating with others to achieve a common goal (Hu & Liden, 2015). 
            <h3> When 
            we cooperate we assume a  <span class="oval"><span class="oval-text">communicative responsibility</span></span></h3>, incorporating and accounting for other people's efforts to create a 
            shared understanding of the situation (Aune et al., 2005; Youk & Park, 2023). 
        </p>
        

    <h2> Key Findings </h2>
    <p> TBD! Research in progress... but here's how its going...</p>

        <h2> Research Questions </h2>
            <p> Prior literature has yet to examine the function of spatial 
                communication in team performance within virtual environments, coined "collective spatial cognition" (Dalton et al., 2019; Curton & Montello, 2023). 
                Video game genres, such as multiplayer 
                online battle arenas or MOBAs, offer a rich virtual environment to examine collective spatial knowledge 
                towards a shared goal. </p></p>
                <p> Understanding effective linguistic and nonlinguistic teamwork is crucial for <span class="oval"><span class="oval-text">all navigators</span></span>(e.g. firefighters,
                    first responders, military personnel, etc.)
                </p>

            <p>Here, I explore Apex Legends and record the spatial cues players use to engage in cooperative activities.
           </p>


    <h2> Methodology </h2>
    <p> Data collection will be conducted using Apex Legends streaming content uploaded to the platform Twitch; 
        data from one match per each unique participant video will be used. The videos will be collected by sorting using the Twitch relevancy algorithm with the aim of 35 videos. We will use a codebook to collect instances of verbal and non-verbal spatial communication data, as well as measure ‘team efficacy’, 
        tallied through the frequency of the elimination of other teams.</p>

        <p> I will conduct linear regressions in R and follow up with post-hoc analyses. </p>
