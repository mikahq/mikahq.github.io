    <p> Abstract for a 2024 Study (WIP) <br>
          <br>
          " In 2020, the electronic sports (esports) market accrued 1.1 billion USD in sales around the world, 
          rising in popularity (Newzoo, 2019). Prior research has found that playing these team-focused action 
          video games, such as First Person Shooter Games, have had a marked effect on the domain of spatial cognition, 
          such as spatial imagery, and found a connection between video game performance and sensory, 
          visual attentional, fine motor control, and memory mechanisms (Bediou et al., 2018; Brunyé et al., 2012; Spence & Feng, 2010). 
          In teams, people engage in prosocial behavior, collaborating with others to achieve a common goal (Hu & Liden, 2015). Indeed, to 
          cooperate with others, people assume a communicative responsibility, incorporating and accounting for their partner’s efforts to create a 
          shared understanding of the situation (Aune et al., 2005; Youk & Park, 2023). Despite a call for further research regarding 
          collective spatial cognition, specifically task-specific social wayfinding, the literature has yet to examine the function of spatial 
          communication in team performance within virtual environments (Dalton et al., 2019; Curton & Montello, 2023). Video game genres, such as multiplayer 
          online battle arenas or MOBAs, offer a rich virtual environment to examine collective spatial knowledge 
          towards a shared goal. In a MOBA such as Apex Legends, players engage in prosocial behavior within a triad competing 
          against other teams, sharing spatial information as a function of this ‘communicative responsibility.’ 
          The current study aims to progress the understanding of collective spatial knowledge and identify the subsequent 
          communicative cues that lead to effective collaboration.
