    <p> In 2020, the electronic sports (esports) market accrued 1.1 billion USD in sales around the world, 
        rising in popularity (Newzoo, 2019). Many multiplayer games revolve around objectives based on teamwork; in teams, people engage in prosocial behavior, collaborating with others to achieve a common goal (Hu & Liden, 2015). </p>
          <h3> 
          When we cooperate we assume a  <span class="oval"><span class="oval-text">communicative responsibility</span></span>, 
          incorporating and accounting for other people's efforts to create a 
          shared understanding of the situation (Aune et al., 2005; Youk & Park, 2023). 
      </p>
      <p> Question: </p>
      <p>
      What leads to efficient spatial communication in teams within a goal-orientated virtual world, both linguistically and as afforded by technology?

            <h4> <i> Brainstorm! </i> </h4>
            <p> Thinking about how pro-players may use tools and communication tactics 
                made me think more critically about communication patterns that emerge 
                when we are under pressure!

        <div class="column">
            <h4> <i> Visual Design </i> </h4>
            <p> Creating a poster meant for communicating science is very different than Designing
                for a brand or event, and I learned how to make my points more succint and 
                use effective visuals.

        <div class="column">
            <h4> <i> Storytelling </i> </h4>
            <p> I'm finding that half of communicating research is linking your findings to a broader discussion topic
                and showing people the "so what?" of your research, which hopefully is demonstrated here!
