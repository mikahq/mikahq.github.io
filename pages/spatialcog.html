    <p> I spent my time in the Spatial Thinking Lab researching 
        how spatial experiences impacting performance in immersive Virtual Reality & desktop tasks. 
        I also worked as a lead on an independent project on spatial activities, on creating reproducible
        scripts for data analysis, administering cognitive desktop tasks and surveys, and acting as
        the lab manager by helping train new research assistants.
    </p>

    <p> Spatial abilities can be developed by training and everyday experience, 
        but we know little about how different
            <span class="oval"><span class="oval-text">types of experiences</span></span> 
            are related to 
        specific spatial competencies. Does using maps while hiking improve skill in 
        navigation? Does playing video games improve the same (i.e. navigation) or different 
        (e.g., mental rotation) abilities?  We were also interested in how the interface of the test interacted with people's performance and experience.</p>
       <h3 style="color: rgb(158, 158, 158);"> Would there be a familiarity with the controls of desktop tasks (computer) as opposed to 
        immersive virtual reality? </h3>

            <h4> <i> Be specific and concise </i> </h4>
            <p> Working on manuscripts and writing procedures has helped me understand how to 
                use fewer words to explain our experimental methods. Telling a story should be
                gripping yet effective!

            <h4> <i> Reproducible code</i> </h4>
            <p> I wrote adjusted code in R to process data from a Mental Rotation Task from a large dataset. 
                This taught me how to ensure that my own code should be <i>accessible</i> (using
                R Markdown), <i>creative </i> and <i> efficient</i> (understanding which commands to use), and
                ask for help when I needed to, by refering to more experienced coders to create the best script possible.

            <p> Whether it was choosing the statistical method or choosing an exclusion criteria,
                the method should be supported by prior research in mind and/or discussed with multiple members
                on the team.
