          ²I work with data and coding helps me do that. <a href="pages/montyhallproblem.html"> I learned R.</a> 
        I used Python, Tableau, and Observable plot to create a 
        <a href="pages/info_vis.html">data-driven narrative into reading seasonality, books, and their patrons</a>. 
        I've also held <a href="/pages/artportfolio.html">design and marketing roles</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          ³I like working on problems that help people. I <a href="pages/bart.html">examined how people interact with the transist system, BART,</a> 
        and worked with KQED, a public radio station to better understand their audience.
