      <p>
       1. Studied psychology 
        and <a href= "pages/socdev.html">how kids develop expectations around race</a>. 
       
        </p>
        <p>
         2. I used Python, Tableau, and Observable Plot to create a 
        <a href="pages/info_vis.html">data-driven narrative into reading seasonality, books, and their patrons</a>. 
        <p> 3. I also took a look at data from <a href="pages/metroArt.html">New York's MTA's Art installation.</a></p>
        </p>
        <p>
       4.  <a href="pages/bart.html"> Examined how people interact with the transit system, BART,</a> 
        and worked with KQED, a public radio station, to better understand their audience. 
        </p>
