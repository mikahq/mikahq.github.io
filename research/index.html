            <p> <strong> Research Interests </strong></p>
          <p> I hope to focus future work on the intersection of spatial cognition 
            and devlopmental psychology by broadly examining children's development of spatial concepts and spatial experience.
           <br></br>
            Currently I examine how spatial experience impacts spatial performance 
            on large-scale tasks, measuring a holistic navigation knowledge, compared to small scale tasks,
            which more closely relates to object rotation.
           
            I also look at social-cognitive development, specifically investigating children's
            judgments and perceptions of an individual who chooses to contextually present their racial identity.
            
            Lastly I investigated how video games act as a complex learning and 
            flow-inducing interface in the context of media psychology and competitive video gaming.

                <em> Abstract </em>
                <p> Previous research demonstrates that spatial training improves one's proficiency in spatial tasks
                    (Uttal et al., 2013). This correlational study investigates spatial activities and their influence on
                    spatial tasks in desktop and immersive virtual reality. We hypothesized that increased video
                    game and navigation experience would lead to increased performance on desktop and immersive
                    virtual reality tasks. Participants navigated routes and indicated direction of objects, measured by
                    pointing accuracy and way-finding efficiency in desktop and immersive VR tasks. Participants
                    completed self-report questionnaires about previous spatial activity and video game experience.
                    There was a significant correlation between participants with more navigation experience and
                    pointing accuracy in immersive Virtual Reality; one gaming measure correlated marginally with
                    immersive Virtual Reality way-finding efficiency, r(112) = -.19, p = 0.04. Increased gaming
                    experience did not correlate with immersive Virtual Reality pointing error, but did correlate with
                    desktop pointing error. Limitations about this study and implications of video game experience
                    on these measures are discussed.</p>

            <p>  <h4> Honors Thesis </h4>
              <p> I am working on an honors' thesis about children’s perceptions regarding 
                biracial identity. I will attach a file of the paper below after its completion (2024), 
                  as well as a PDF. My past work in this area includes an interest in free will 
                  beliefs in children, and categorization of concepts.</p>
          

              <p><strong>Research Area 3: Video Games & Media Psychology</strong>
                <p> Abstract for a 2024 Study (WIP) <br>
                  <br>
                  " In 2020, the electronic sports (esports) market accrued 1.1 billion USD in sales around the world, 
                  rising in popularity (Newzoo, 2019). Prior research has found that playing these team-focused action 
                  video games, such as First Person Shooter Games, have had a marked effect on the domain of spatial cognition, 
                  such as spatial imagery, and found a connection between video game performance and sensory, 
                  visual attentional, fine motor control, and memory mechanisms (Bediou et al., 2018; Brunyé et al., 2012; Spence & Feng, 2010). 
                  In teams, people engage in prosocial behavior, collaborating with others to achieve a common goal (Hu & Liden, 2015). Indeed, to 
                  cooperate with others, people assume a communicative responsibility, incorporating and accounting for their partner’s efforts to create a 
                  shared understanding of the situation (Aune et al., 2005; Youk & Park, 2023). Despite a call for further research regarding 
                  collective spatial cognition, specifically task-specific social wayfinding, the literature has yet to examine the function of spatial 
                  communication in team performance within virtual environments (Dalton et al., 2019; Curton & Montello, 2023). Video game genres, such as multiplayer 
                  online battle arenas or MOBAs, offer a rich virtual environment to examine collective spatial knowledge 
                  towards a shared goal. In a MOBA such as Apex Legends, players engage in prosocial behavior within a triad competing 
                  against other teams, sharing spatial information as a function of this ‘communicative responsibility.’ 
                  The current study aims to progress the understanding of collective spatial knowledge and identify the subsequent 
                  communicative cues that lead to effective collaboration.

                  <em> Eyewitness Testimony </em>
                  <p>How important are eyewitness testimonies? We investigated the potential effect of authoritative eyewitness testimony, and the veracity of the testimony on juror decision-making. 
  
                      When our memory has discrepancies, we utilize a source-monitoring framework which suggests we confuse the source of our information between multiple sources. 
                      
                      Here, 55 college-age participants saw a video of a car crash and read a testimony, relayed by an eyewitness differing in authority (police officer or bystander) and in testimony content (true or false relative to the facts in the video). Participants completed a 10-question-posttest, where they recalled details of the event. 
                      
                      No significant effects were found for any manipulated condition on the posttest. There was a significant interaction between authoritative condition and perceived confidence in participant accuracy of their recall. These findings suggest that jurors do not factor in testimony when recalling detailed events, but do deliberate more when an authority figure is presented.</p>

                  <p> The Social Cognitive Development Lab runs miniature research questions based on findings from various papers on developmental psychology. I decided to spearhead a question of my own, 
                      based on paradigms in developmental psychology on the topic of children’s development in the belief of free will. I collected data from our adult lab participants (N= 13) and ran analyses in R. This was in a timeframe of one week!</p>
