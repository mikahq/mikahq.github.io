                <h4> Honors Thesis </h4>
                <p> I am working on an honors' thesis about children’s perceptions regarding 
                  biracial identity. My hypotheses for the project will be written as an agent based model 
                  to simulate what the potential data collection could look like.
                  I will attach a file of the paper below after its completion (2024), 
                    as well as a PDF. </p>
                <br> 

                <h1> Research Papers</h1>
        <p>There are three research papers to date to look at, with two expected at the end of 2023. 
          They completely detail my processes and implementation. 
          The abstracts for each are written below!</p>

            <p> <h4> Spatial cogntion </h4>
                <p> Previous research demonstrates that spatial training improves one's proficiency in spatial tasks
                    (Uttal et al., 2013). This correlational study investigates spatial activities and their influence on
                    spatial tasks in0 desktop and immersive virtual reality. We hypothesized that increased video
                    game and navigation experience would lead to increased performance on desktop and immersive
                    virtual reality tasks. Participants navigated routes and indicated direction of objects, measured by
                    pointing accuracy and way-finding efficiency in desktop and immersive VR tasks. Participants
                    completed self-report questionnaires about previous spatial activity and video game experience.
                    There was a significant correlation between participants with more navigation experience and
                    pointing accuracy in immersive Virtual Reality; one gaming measure correlated marginally with
                    immersive Virtual Reality way-finding efficiency, r(112) = -.19, p = 0.04. Increased gaming
                    experience did not correlate with immersive Virtual Reality pointing error, but did correlate with
                    desktop pointing error. Limitations about this study and implications of video game experience
                    on these measures are discussed.</p>

                    <h4> Eyewitness testimony </h4>
                <p>How important are eyewitness testimonies? We investigated the potential effect of authoritative eyewitness testimony, and the veracity of the testimony on juror decision-making. 

                    When our memory has discrepancies, we utilize a source-monitoring framework which suggests we confuse the source of our information between multiple sources. 
                    
                    Here, 55 college-age participants saw a video of a car crash and read a testimony, relayed by an eyewitness differing in authority (police officer or bystander) and in testimony content (true or false relative to the facts in the video). Participants completed a 10-question-posttest, where they recalled details of the event. 
                    
                    No significant effects were found for any manipulated condition on the posttest. There was a significant interaction between authoritative condition and perceived confidence in participant accuracy of their recall. These findings suggest that jurors do not factor in testimony when recalling detailed events, but do deliberate more when an authority figure is presented.</p>

                <h4> Free Will: a report</h4>
                <p> The Social Cognitive Development Lab runs miniature research questions based on findings from various papers on developmental psychology. I decided to spearhead a question of my own, 
                    based on paradigms in developmental psychology on the topic of children’s development in the belief of free will. I collected data from our adult lab participants (N= 13) and ran analyses in R. This was in a timeframe of one week!</p>
